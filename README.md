# SmartFPS

An Smart Free FPS Controller (WIP)


# How to use

Download or Clone, or Download UnityPackage File from Release. Import/Open it on Unity Engine, version should be 2018.2.7f1 or Higher. 

# Knowledgebase

• For this version, we've used Unity PPS ver 1. Which is currently deprecated from Unity Asset Store. Unity would recommend you to update to ver 2. 

• If you want to use only clean Player Controller, please remove all other unnecessary scripts and files from the asset, then export it as Unity Package. 

• Visible body or Full Body Awarness was WIP. Some Animations from Mixamo was imported to /Animations folder. We wrote a Shader for visible body, which will cast shadow but won't show material. We will upload it soon. 

• Parkour System was in Development Pipeline. Somehow, development of this project has been stopped, there is a probability of no support or future release from us. Or, maybe, all future updates will be stable, paid and uploaded to Unity Asset Store.

• Glock-19 Animation was made for Last Breath by Electronic Brain. Animations are free to use. But, Reproduction is strictly prohibated. 

• Everythings in SFPS was developed by the Algorithmic Sector of Electronic Brain, including me (Srejon Khan) & Ashikur Rahman as a part of the team.
